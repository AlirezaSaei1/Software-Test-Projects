\section{Introduction}


In this comprehensive report, we embark on an exploration and evaluation of a Train Reservation System using a dual-approach testing methodology. Leveraging the power of JUnit and Gherkin, we conduct a thorough examination of the system's functionalities, ensuring its robustness, reliability, and adherence to business requirements.\\

JUnit, a widely adopted testing framework for Java applications, provides a solid foundation for scenario-based testing. Through the creation of five detailed scenarios, we utilize JUnit to meticulously assess various aspects of the Train Reservation System. These scenarios encompass critical functionalities such as City and Train Management, Trip Management, Ticket Booking and Cancellation, Delay Management, and Exchange Management (With Gherkin).\\

Complementing our JUnit tests, we employ Gherkin, a language-agnostic format, to write three additional scenarios. Gherkin facilitates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) by allowing us to describe system behavior in a natural language format that is easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\\

This integrated approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the Train Reservation System, covering both the low-level unit testing provided by JUnit and the high-level behavioral testing facilitated by Gherkin. By combining these two testing methodologies, we aim to provide a robust and thorough validation of the system's functionality, ensuring its readiness for deployment in real-world scenarios.

\section{Test Scenario 2: Trip Management}
\bigskip
\bigskip
\subsection{Test Case 2.1: Create a New Trip}

\textbf{Description:} Verify that a new trip can be added to the system considering the specific constraints.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is running.
  \item The user is authorized to add a new trip.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Provide valid details for the new trip: Origin
  \item Provide valid details for the new trip: Destination
  \item Provide valid details for the new trip: Train
  \item Provide valid details for the new trip: Departure Time
  \item Provide valid details for the new trip: Arrival Time
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Result:} The new trip should be created and registered in the system.

\subsection{Test Case 2.2: Cancel Trip}

\textbf{Description:} Verify that a trip can be canceled in the system.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is running.
  \item The user is authorized to cancel a trip.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select a trip to cancel

\subsection{Test Case 2.3: Add a trip with conflicting timings to a train}

\textbf{Description:} Verify that a trip with conflicting times cannot be added to the train trips list.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is running.
  \item The user is authorized to add a trip.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add a valid trip to train
  \item Add a new trip that has intercepting times with previous trip
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Result:} The second should not be added to the trips list of the train, and a trip exception must be thrown.

\section{Test Scenario 3: Ticket Booking and Cancellation}
\bigskip
\bigskip
\subsection{Test Case 3.1: Book a Ticket}

\textbf{Description:} Verify that a new ticket can be booked for a trip if the trip has not reached the maximum number of passengers.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is running.
  \item The user is authorized to book a ticket.
  \item There is an available trip.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select and available trip
  \item Provide passenger name
  \item Book a ticket
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Result:}  A new ticket should be booked for the selected trip.

\subsection{Test Case 3.2: Cancel a Ticket}

\textbf{Description:} Verify that a booked ticket can be canceled.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is running.
  \item The user has a booked ticket.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select a booked ticket
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Result:} The selected ticket should be canceled, and the trip should be updated accordingly.
