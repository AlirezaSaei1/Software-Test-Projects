## Assignment 1 and 2: Train Reservation System Testing

These assignments involve testing a train reservation system. The tasks include:

- **Assignment 1:** Writing test cases for the train reservation system Using `JUnit` and `Cucumber`.
- **Assignment 2:** Executing the test cases and documenting the results.


## Assignment 3: CFG Tester

In this assignment, you will work with a Control Flow Graph (CFG) tester. The goal is to:

- Find all prime paths in the CFG.
- Use the prime paths to identify all available test paths.


## Assignment 4: Write DU Paths from a CFG

For this assignment, you will write Definition-Use (DU) paths from a given CFG. This involves:

- Identifying definitions and uses of variables.
- Writing paths that cover these definitions and uses.


## Assignment 5: Working with Telerik Test Studio

This assignment focuses on using Telerik Test Studio for automated testing. Tasks include:

- Setting up Telerik Test Studio.
- Creating and executing automated test cases.

## Final Project: Mutation Testing with Grammar

The final project involves mutation testing using grammar, which is language-independent. The project tasks include:

- Creating mutation operators based on grammar.
- Applying mutation testing techniques to evaluate software robustness (using Mutation Score).

Project files and documentation are available in another repository.

## Presentations

The `Presentations` directory contains presentations related to the course. Currently, it includes:

- **Seams in Compiler:** A presentation discussing the concept of seams in compiler.
